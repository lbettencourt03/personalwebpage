    <p>In my portfolio, I chose to display the graphics I created for my web design class. This class was targeted towards demonstrating the most effective means to advertise a restaurant. We had to design our own individual restaurants, create promotional graphics, and form a cohesive brand in order to represent the company we formed. </p>
    <p>When designing my business cards, promotional flyer, and menu, I wanted to keep my design simple and to theme. I made the background of all of my business items aged paper, as I feel it evokes a sense of ancient renaissance. I applied the same thought process while choosing the font and graphics. I wanted to use images that looked more like drawings than digitalized art. While designing my restaurant promotion, I made a conscious effort to attempt to avoid the cartoonish aesthetic many medieval themed restaurants employ in their advertisement. I had a very clear image in my mind of the aesthetic I wanted to portray, and I carefully maintained this aesthetic through my design elements. If I were to change anything in the development of this project, I would make changes to my website. I live in a rather rural area, and my internet could not load wix content. As a result, I had to revert to a website called canvas. While I still feel the design elements of my site are strong, I would have liked to be able to use the organizational abilities of wix while formatting my website. However, despite the technical issues, I am satisfied with the results of my work.</p>
