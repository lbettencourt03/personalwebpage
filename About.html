    <center><h1>About</h1></center>
<p>My name is Lauren Elizabeth Bettencourt. I was born in Melbourne, Florida, on August 19, 2003. I was raised in San Antonio, Texas, where I lived out the majority of my life. I am one of five daughters in a family of seven, and grew up very close to my siblings due to the fact that we were all homeschooled. I attended school online until my graduation from high school in 2021. Throughout both middle school and high school, I competed in track and field cross country and really enjoyed it. Following my graduation, I signed to compete for the University of New Mexico, to run for the track and cross country teams. </p>
<p>Entering college, I knew I wanted to pursue a major involving writing in some way. Since I was young, I have always enjoyed the creative liberty and imaginative nature of writing. Thus, I chose mass communications and journalism to be my major. Following my graduation, I plan on pursuing a career in either journalism or some form of public relations. These jobs would offer my the ability to pursue writing, and allow me to work remotely. This class in web design has given my an edge in this potential career. Being knowledgable in web design could help me implicate my promotional content into the websites themselves. It will also allow me to be able to create my own websites in the chance that I develop my own company. Going forward, I hope to find a situation in which I can put the skills I have learned to good use. </p>
