    <h3>Additional Info: </h3>
    <p>The process of creating my own restaurant and brand identity played into my love of creativity and imagination, and I delved into the project with enthusiasm and inspiration. One of my favorite genres of music is indie folk, and often while listening to this music I imagine it being played in a medieval tavern. This project gave me the opportunity to create an organized concept for this tavern! Additionally, I have always had an interest in apothecary and herbal healing. Thus, the concept for Milk &amp; Honey Apothecary was born! I wanted to create a medieval style restaurant that offered both a tavern-like feel, and a stocked apothecary offering elixirs and potions. This immersive fantasy experience would allow families and friends to gather and escape the faded minimalism of many of todays restaurant, and instead dine in fantastical environment filled with whimsy and cheer. My restaurant would cater to young and old, but primarily caters to those passionate about renaissance and fantasy role play experiences. My brand will be associated with renaissance experience events, inclusion, and familiarity. My business seeks to familiarize itself with its patrons, and employees will make an effort to become a friend of all our guests.</p>
