    <p>Welcome to my complete personal website assignment. Within this website you will find my about page, with information about myself and my personal life, the education page which lists my academic achievments and educational information, and the portfolio page with examples of my work. See the contact page for any necessary contact information. </p>
    <p>I quite enjoyed the process of creating this web page. While designing it, I decided I wanted to go with a simple design with an emphasis on a &quot;dreamlike&quot; design. I prioritized function over intricacy, and strove to make a simple, easy to navigate layout. The color pallet i chose is comprised mainly out of various shades of whites, reds, purples, and blue. Although these colors together do not sound like they'd create a positive contrast, their muted nature through these pastel forms of color allow them to form a cohesive presentation throughout the website. The font I chose was purposed to be clearly legible and professional. I initially had some concerns regarding the contrast between the professionalism of the font and the more create nature of the graphics and colors. However, I believe that they work together well with the layout and design I have established.</p>
    <p>The technical aspect of the project was fairly simple, and I relied on much of what I learned in previous assignments. I did have issues with alignment of my text, as I had difficulty separating the headings and body paragraphs. Despite these difficulties, I found the process as a whole to be fairly straightforward and enjoyable. </p>
